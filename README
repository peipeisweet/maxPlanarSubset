This program solves the Maximum Planar Subset problem by finding the maximum number of non-intersecting chords in a circle and listing the chords in the solution.
Here's the directory structure:

To build the instructions:
  1. make sure you are in the root of the project
  2. run the command "make", which will create the executable mps in the directory ./bin/

To run the execution instructions, you can run the command "./bin/mps ./inputs/<input_file> ./outputs/outputs/<output_file>"

To clean the .o file that generated by the "make" command, you can run the command "make clean"

To compress the project into a .tgz file, you can run the command:
  tar zcvf b11901072_pa2.tgz ./b11901072_pa2/
This command will create a .tgz file behind the project

To verify the execution result, you can run the command:
  bash ./b11901072_pa2/utilities/checkSubmitPA2.sh b11901072_pa2.tgz
** check that you compress this project before you run this code **

Input Format:
  1. the first line contains an interger 2n with 0 <= n <= 90000, representing the number of vertices.
  2. following n lines each contain two intergers a and b, representing endpoints of a chord.
  3. in the last sentence is a single "0". 

Output Format:
  1. the first line contains an integer representing the size of the maximum planar subset.
  2. following lines contain two integers, representing the endpoints of each of the chord in the solution.
